# Quantum <span className="text-primary">Express</span><Trademark />

Introducing Cosmo Cargo's fastest shipping tier. Quantum Express leverages entanglement-based
logistics to deliver your cargo across the galaxy in record time.

## How It Works <Badge variant="secondary">New</Badge>

Quantum Express uses paired particle arrays to instantaneously transfer shipment manifests and
tracking data. While physical cargo still travels via conventional warp drives, our quantum-linked
network ensures:

- **Instant confirmation** of delivery across any distance
- **Real-time cargo monitoring** without light-speed delay
- **Predictive routing** using quantum probability calculations

## Service Tiers

| Tier       | Max Distance   | Transit Time | Quantum Link |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| QE-Local   | 1 AU           | 2-4 hours    | Basic        |
| QE-System  | 50 AU          | 12-24 hours  | Enhanced     |
| QE-Stellar | 10 light-years | 3-7 days     | Premium      |

## Requirements

To use Quantum Express, your shipments must meet these criteria:

1. **Mass limit**: Under 500kg per package
2. **No quantum-sensitive materials**: Items that could interfere with entanglement arrays
3. **Registered quantum receiver**: Destination must have compatible receiving equipment
4. **Insurance**: Mandatory quantum transit insurance

## API Integration

Enable Quantum Express by setting the `service_tier` parameter:

```json
{
  "shipment": {
    "service_tier": "quantum_express",
    "quantum_priority": "high",
    "entanglement_pair_id": "QP-7X9-ALPHA"
  }
}
```

## Pricing

Quantum Express pricing is calculated based on distance, mass, and current entanglement array
availability. Use our [rate calculator](/api-shipments) to get real-time quotes.
