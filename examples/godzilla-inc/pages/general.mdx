Welcome to **Godzilla Inc.**, the ultimate platform for managing the King of
Monsters! Whether you're a city official looking to track his latest stomping
grounds, a scientist trying to calm his epic temper, or just a fan hoping to
feed him his next snack, our API has you covered.

At **Godzilla Inc.**, we embrace the chaos and majesty of Godzilla. While others may see him as a giant lizard wreaking havoc, we see a misunderstood force of nature. Our mission is to provide developers with the tools to interact with and manage Godzilla responsibly—because if you can't stop the rampage, you might as well steer it in the right direction.

## What Can You Do with the Godzilla API?

Our API allows you to interact with Godzilla in ways you’ve only dreamed (or had nightmares) about:

- **Track His Movements**: Wondering where Godzilla is at any given moment? Use our location services to pinpoint his position. Handy for evacuation plans—or fan meetups, if you're brave enough.
- **Feed the Beast**: Godzilla can eat anything, but let's be honest—he’s got a soft spot for meat (and an inexplicable preference for gorillas). Keep him happy by sending food his way.
- **Control His Mood**: Godzilla’s mood swings are the stuff of legend. From calm and contemplative to outright destructive, use our API to influence his emotional state (results may vary).
- **Save a City**: Want to play hero? Remove a city from Godzilla's destruction list. But choose wisely—he’s got a long memory.

## Who Is This API For?

The **Godzilla API** is designed for:

1. **City Planners**: Prepare for potential monster-sized disruptions.
2. **Researchers**: Study Godzilla’s behavior, movements, and preferences.
3. **Monster Enthusiasts**: Engage with the King of Monsters on a personal level.
4. **Game Developers**: Create the ultimate Godzilla game by integrating real-world monster interaction.

## How Does It Work?

Our RESTful API provides a suite of endpoints that are intuitive, flexible, and (mostly) safe to use. Each endpoint is carefully designed to give you control over specific aspects of Godzilla’s behavior. You can use standard HTTP methods such as:

- **GET**: Retrieve data about Godzilla's location, mood, or recent activity.
- **POST**: Send data, like his next meal (just don’t skimp on the portions).
- **PUT**: Update his mood and help de-escalate tense situations.
- **DELETE**: Save cities from his wrath—one at a time.

## A Few Things to Keep in Mind

- **Godzilla has an appetite.** While you can feed him anything, offering less than a metric ton might offend him.
- **Cities can’t always be saved.** If a city is already under Godzilla’s foot, you’re too late. Timing is everything!
- **Handle with care.** Remember, this API interacts with a 300-foot monster. Use your powers wisely, and always consider the consequences.
