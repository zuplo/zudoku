# Intergalactic Shipping

Ship Happens is proud to offer cutting-edge interstellar shipping solutions for businesses operating beyond Earth's atmosphere. Our API provides seamless integration for managing shipments across the solar system and beyond.

## Intergalactic Shipping Features

- **Solar System Coverage**: Ship to any established colony or station within our solar system
- **Deep Space Transport**: Extended shipping routes to Alpha Centauri and Proxima Centauri systems
- **Zero-G Handling**: Specialized packaging and handling for zero-gravity environments
- **Radiation Protection**: Advanced shielding for sensitive cargo
- **Cryogenic Storage**: Temperature-controlled shipping for long-duration transits
- **Quantum Tracking**: Real-time shipment tracking across light-years

## Best Practices for Interstellar Shipping

### Documentation Requirements

When shipping beyond Earth, ensure you provide:

- Planetary origin and destination codes
- Anti-matter containment certificates (if applicable)
- Xenobiological clearance forms
- Gravitational variance declarations
- Solar radiation exposure logs

### Restricted Items

Be aware of:

- Planet-specific atmospheric restrictions
- Banned substances in different solar systems
- Quantum-sensitive materials
- Biological containment requirements
- Dark matter regulations

### Shipping Tips

1. **Vacuum Sealing**: All packages must be vacuum-sealed for space transit
2. **Mass Calculations**: Account for varying gravitational fields
3. **Time Dilation**: Factor in relativistic effects for delivery estimates
4. **Emergency Protocols**: Include backup navigation beacons
5. **Quantum Encryption**: Use approved encryption for tracking data
