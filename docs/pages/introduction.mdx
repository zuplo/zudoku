title: Introduction
description: Zudoku (pronounced "zoo-doh-koo") is an open-source, highly customizable API documentation framework for building quality developer experiences using MDX and OpenAPI.
---

The framework was created because great API documentation frameworks should always be:

- ✅ Free
- ✅ OpenAPI powered
- ✅ Extensible
- ✅ Low barrier to entry
- ✅ Easy to maintain

## Features

Out of the box, Zudoku can:

- 🚀 Generate documentation from a single or multiple [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) schema.
- 📄 Create [MDX pages](https://mdxjs.com/) for anything you want to document.
- 🔐 Integrate your users with authentication via OpenID or OAuth2.
- 🧪 Let users test their API calls using the integrated playground (includes authentication!).
- 🎨 Be styled however you like. Dark mode is there by default (of course!).

Zudoku is quick to implement, easy to configure and is highly composable with sensible defaults.

## Try Zudoku

You can test Zudoku with your own API now at [zudoku.dev](https://zudoku.dev).

Just drop in the URL for your OpenAPI document and you'll get a fully functional _Zudoku-ized_ version of it to play around with.
