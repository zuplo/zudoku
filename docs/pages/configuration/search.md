Zudoku offers search functionality that enhances user experience by enabling content discovery across your site. When configured, a search bar will appear in the header, allowing users to quickly find relevant information on any page.

We currently support two search providers:

- [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/)
- [Inkeep](https://inkeep.com/)

## Pagefind

[Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) is a lightweight, static search library that can be used to add search to your Zudoku site without any external services.

While functional for production use, the Pagefind integration is still work in progress and will be improved in future releases and become the default search provider.

:::

To enable pagefind search, configure the `search` option in your configuration:

```typescript
{
  search: {
    type: "pagefind",
    // Optional: Maximum number of sub results per page
    maxSubResults: 3
    // Optional: Configure search result ranking (defaults shown below)
    ranking: {
      termFrequency: 0.8,
      pageLength: 0.6,
      termSimilarity: 1.2,
      termSaturation: 1.2,
    },
  }
}
```

For more information about how Pagefind's ranking system works and how to customize it for your content, see the [Pagefind ranking documentation](https://pagefind.app/docs/ranking/).

## Inkeep

To add Inkeep search to your site you will need to copy some variables from your [Inkeep account setting](https://portal.inkeep.com/):

- API Key
- Integration ID
- Organization ID

With these you can then configure the `search` option in [Zudoku Configuration](./overview.md):

```typescript
{
  // ...
  search: {
    type: "inkeep",
    apiKey: "<your-api-key>",
    integrationId: "<your-integration-id>",
    organizationId: "<your-organization-id>",
    primaryBrandColor: "#26D6FF",
    organizationDisplayName: "Your Organization Name",
  }
  // ...
}
```
