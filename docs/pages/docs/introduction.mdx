title: Introduction
description: Zudoku (pronounced "zoo-doh-koo") is an open-source, highly customizable API documentation framework for building quality developer experiences using MDX and OpenAPI.
---

The framework was created because great API documentation frameworks should always be:

✅ Free<br />
✅ OpenAPI powered<br />
✅ Extensible<br />
✅ Low barrier to entry<br />
✅ Easy to maintain<br />

## Features

Out of the box, Zudoku can:

🚀 Generate documentation from a single or multiple [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) schema.<br />
📄 Create static [MDX pages](https://mdxjs.com/) for anything you want to document.<br />
🔐 Integrate your users with authentication via OpenID or OAuth2.<br />
🧪 Let users test their API calls using the integrated playground (includes authentication!).<br />
🎨 Be styled however you like. Dark mode is there by default (of course!).

Zudoku is quick to implement, easy to configure and is highly composable with sensible defaults.


## Try Zudoku
You can test Zudoku with your own API now at [zudoku.dev](https://zudoku.dev).

Just drop in the URL for your OpenAPI document and you'll get a fully functional _Zudoku-ized_ version of it to play around with.
