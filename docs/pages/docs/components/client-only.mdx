title: ClientOnly
sidebar_icon: monitor
---

A component that only renders its children on the client-side, preventing hydration mismatches
between server and client rendering.

## Props

```ts
type ClientOnlyProps = {
  children: ReactNode;
  fallback?: ReactNode;
};
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```tsx
<ClientOnly>
  <SomeClientOnlyComponent />
</ClientOnly>
```

### With Fallback

```tsx
<ClientOnly fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <InteractiveWidget />
</ClientOnly>
```

## Examples

```tsx
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>This renders on both server and client</h1>
      <ClientOnly fallback={<Spinner />}>
        <ComponentThatUsesWindowObject />
      </ClientOnly>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Use Cases

- **Browser APIs**: Components that use `window`, `document`, or other browser-only APIs
- **Third-party Libraries**: Libraries that don't support SSR
- **Theme Switches**: Preventing flash of incorrect theme
- **Interactive Widgets**: Components with complex client-side state
- **Conditional Features**: Features that should only appear on the client

## Notes

:::caution Use ClientOnly sparingly as it can impact SEO and initial page load performance. Only use
it when necessary for components that cannot be server-rendered. :::

:::tip Always provide a meaningful fallback that matches the approximate size and layout of your
client-only component to prevent layout shifts. :::
