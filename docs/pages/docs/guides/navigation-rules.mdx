title: Navigation Rules
sidebar_icon: list-tree
---

When you add an OpenAPI spec to Zudoku, the sidebar is generated automatically from the schema's
tags and operations. Navigation rules let you extend or modify that sidebar without changing the
schema itself. Common use cases include inserting getting-started docs, adding external links, or
hiding deprecated endpoints.

## Setup

Navigation rules require two things in your `zudoku.config.tsx`:

1. A `navigation` entry that creates a tab linked to your API
2. A `navigationRules` array with rules that target that tab

```tsx
import type { ZudokuConfig } from "zudoku";

const config: ZudokuConfig = {
  apis: [
    {
      type: "file",
      input: "./schema/shipments.json",
      path: "api-shipments",
    },
  ],
  navigation: [{ type: "link", label: "Shipments", to: "/api-shipments" }],
  navigationRules: [
    // rules go here
  ],
};
```

## Inserting docs

Use `type: "insert"` to add items before or after a matched sidebar item. The `match` string uses
the tab label as the first segment and navigates into the sidebar tree.

```tsx
navigationRules: [
  {
    type: "insert",
    match: "Shipments/0",
    position: "before",
    items: [
      {
        type: "doc",
        file: "api-shipments/getting-started",
        icon: "plane-takeoff",
      },
    ],
  },
],
```

This inserts a "Getting Started" doc before the first item in the Shipments sidebar.

The MDX file lives at `pages/api-shipments/getting-started.mdx` (under your configured docs
directory, matching the API's base path).

## Adding links

You can insert external or internal links the same way:

```tsx
{
  type: "insert",
  match: "Shipments/-1",
  position: "after",
  items: [
    {
      type: "link",
      label: "System Status",
      to: "/status",
      icon: "satellite",
    },
  ],
}
```

The `-1` index targets the last item, and `position: "after"` places the link at the very end of the
sidebar.

## Modifying items

Use `type: "modify"` to change properties of existing sidebar items like their icon, label, or
collapsed state:

```tsx
{
  type: "modify",
  match: "Shipments/Shipment Management",
  set: { icon: "box", collapsed: true },
}
```

## Removing items

`type: "remove"` hides items from the sidebar. This is rarely needed since it's usually better to
fix the underlying source, but can be useful as a quick workaround:

```tsx
{
  type: "remove",
  match: "Shipments/Deprecated Endpoint",
}
```

## Complete example

This is the configuration used in the Cosmo Cargo demo shown above:

```tsx
navigationRules: [
  {
    type: "insert",
    match: "Shipments/Shipment",
    position: "before",
    items: [
      {
        type: "doc",
        file: "api-shipments/getting-started",
        icon: "plane-takeoff",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    type: "insert",
    match: "Shipments/-1",
    position: "after",
    items: [
      {
        type: "link",
        label: "System Status",
        to: "/status",
        icon: "satellite",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    type: "modify",
    match: "Shipments/1",
    set: { icon: "box" },
  },
],
```
