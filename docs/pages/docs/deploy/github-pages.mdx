[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to publish your documentation. Especially if you are using GitHub for source control.

## Prerequisites

To publish your site to GitHub Pages you will need:

- A GitHub account

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

GitHub offers two different ways to create Pages sites.

1. Publish from a [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-from-a-branch)
2. Publish using a [GitHub Actions Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow)

It's up to you which approach you choose but our recommended approach is to use the [GitHub Actions Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow).
