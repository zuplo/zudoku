Zudoku can produce a build of static HTML, JavaScript and CSS files that you can deploy directly to your own server.

## Build locally

To prepare the files you need to upload to your server, you will need to use the build command.

```
npm run build
```

Once complete, you will see a new `dist` folder in the root of your project that includes the files you need to upload.
