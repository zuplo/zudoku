Zudoku supports [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

## Page Titles

Page titles can be added to markdown files using the `#` syntax or via the front matter of the markdown file.

Using markdown headers:

```md
# A Page Title
```

Using front matter:

```md
---
title: A Page Title
---
```
