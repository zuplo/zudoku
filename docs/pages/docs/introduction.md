Zudoku (pronounced "zoo-doh-koo") is an open-source, highly customizable API documentation framework for building quality developer experiences using MDX and OpenAPI.

The framework was created because great API documentation frameworks should always be:

- ✅ Free
- ✅ OpenAPI powered
- ✅ Extensible
- ✅ Low barrier to entry
- ✅ Easy to maintain

## Features

Out of the box, Zudoku can:

- 🚀 Generate documentation from a single or multiple [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) schema.
- 📄 Create [MDX pages](https://mdxjs.com/) for anything you want to document.
- 🔐 Integrate your users with authentication via OpenID or OAuth2.
- 🧪 Let users test their API calls using the integrated playground (includes authentication!).
- 🎨 Be styled however you like. Dark mode is there by default (of course!).

Zudoku is quick to implement, easy to configure and is highly composable with sensible defaults.

## Flexible Setup

Zudoku comes in two flavors. Which one you choose depends on how quickly you want to get up and running and how much customization you want to do.

The two options are:

- **[Custom App (Recommended)](/docs/app-quickstart)**: Create a new React app using `create-zudoku-app` and customize it to your heart's content. This is the most flexible option and allows you to take full advantage of the Zudoku framework. [Open Quickstart](/docs/app-quickstart)
- **[Standalone HTML](/docs/html-quickstart)**: This is the quickest way to get started. Create a single HTML page and drop in the Zudoku script and stylesheet. [Open Quickstart](/docs/html-quickstart)

## Try Zudoku

You can test Zudoku with your own API now at [zudoku.dev](https://zudoku.dev).

Just drop in the URL for your OpenAPI document and you'll get a fully functional _Zudoku-ized_ version of it to play around with.
