The recommended way to get started with Zudoku is to use the `create-zudoku` CLI tool. This tool will scaffold a new Zudoku site for you to customize and build upon.

## Prerequisites

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) at least `v22.7.0` (or `>=20.19` will work as well)

## Getting Started

<Stepper>

1. **Create a new Zudoku app by running:**

   ```bash
   npm create zudoku@latest
   ```

1. Change into your just created directory with `cd zudoku-app{:sh}`
1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Your Zudoku site is now running locally! Next, commit your changes and [deploy the site](./deployment.md) to your preferred hosting provider.
