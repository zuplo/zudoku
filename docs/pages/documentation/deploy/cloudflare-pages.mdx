title: Cloudflare Pages
---

[Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages) is a low configuration way of publishing your documentation.

## Prerequisites

To publish your site to Cloudflare Pages you will need:

- A Cloudflare account
- A GitHub or GitLab account

## Deploying to Pages

Cloudflare offers three different ways to create Pages sites.

1. Using the [Cloudflare CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3/)
2. Directly uploading the files using [drag and drop](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/direct-upload/#drag-and-drop), or their [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/direct-upload/#wrangler-cli)
3. Integration with [GitHub or GitLab](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/git-integration/)

It's up to you which approach you choose but our recommended approach is to use the [GitHub or GitLab integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/git-integration/).
