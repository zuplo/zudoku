## Getting started

Zudoku is a documentation generator that allows you to create beautiful documentation sites with ease. It supports MDX, OpenAPI, and is entirely customizable.

### Start customizing

You can customize your documentation site by modifying the `zudoku.config.js` file in the root of your project. Why not try changing the primary color of your site?

```bash
npx run create-zudoku-app@latest
```
