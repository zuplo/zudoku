## Choose a flavor

Zudoku comes in two flavors. Which one you choose depends on how quickly you want to get up and running and how much customization you want to do.

### Self hosted
This is the full fat version of Zudoku with all the customizable elements available that you can tweak until you've got it perfect.

**Setup**

This version is setup using our command line generator `create-zudoku-app`. All the project files live on your local machine.

**Use this if you want to:**
- Get up and running with Zudoku quickly
- Control the full build and deploy everything yourself
- Customize the look and feel
- Use plugins such as authentication, search
- Use MDX pages to add guides and other information around your OpenAPI documentation

### CDN package
This is a slimmed down version of Zudoku that can be used to create documentation around an OpenAPI document with minimal effort and low maintainance.

**Setup**

The packaged version of Zudoku is hosted on a CDN, can be added to a basic HTML page or React application and is configured using a URL for an OpenAPI document.

**Use this if you want to:**
- Get up and running with Zudoku even faster
- Create API documentation from an OpenAPI document
- Leave the styling at default (light and dark modes are both included)
- Integrate a full API documentation experience into a pre-existing application
