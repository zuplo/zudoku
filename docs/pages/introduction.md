Zudoku (pronounced "zoo-doh-koo") is an open-source, highly customizable API documentation framework for building quality developer experiences using MDX and OpenAPI.

The framework was created because great API documentation frameworks should always be:

- ✅ Free
- ✅ OpenAPI powered
- ✅ Extensible
- ✅ Low barrier to entry
- ✅ Easy to maintain

## Features

Out of the box, Zudoku can:

- 🚀 Generate documentation from a single or multiple [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) schema.
- 📄 Create [MDX pages](https://mdxjs.com/) for anything you want to document.
- 🔐 Integrate your users with authentication via OpenID or OAuth2.
- 🧪 Let users test their API calls using the integrated playground (includes authentication!).
- 🎨 Be styled however you like. Dark mode is there by default (of course!).

Zudoku is quick to implement, easy to configure and is highly composable with sensible defaults.

## Flexible Setup

Zudoku comes with a flexible setup that allows you to customize it to your heart's content.

The recommended way to get started is:

- **[Custom App (Recommended)](./app-quickstart.md)**: Create a new React app using `create-zudoku-app` and customize it to your heart's content. This is the most flexible option and allows you to take full advantage of the Zudoku framework. [Open Quickstart](./app-quickstart.md)
