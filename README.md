# Introduction

**Zudoku** (pronounced _"zoo-doh-koo"_) is an open-source, highly customizable API documentation framework for building quality developer experiences.

Because building great API documentation should always be:

‚úÖ Free<br />
‚úÖ OpenAPI powered<br />
‚úÖ Programmable

Zudoku supports both OpenAPI and GraphQL schemas and is extended via plugins that include features like static content, authentication, monetization, or anything else you can think of.

## ü§© Try it

**Test Zudoku with your own API now at [zudoku.dev](https://zudoku.dev)** and see how good your documentation can look!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

You can use the CLI to generate a new project or use it standalone as a React component.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

Fire up your new API docs from out getting started template:

```
npx create-zudoku-app@latest
```

### üì¶ Standalone via CDN

Add the package and styles to your `<head>` and pass the URL for your API schema to the `data-api-url` property, as shown here:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="https://cdn.zudoku.dev/logos/icon.svg" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Zudoku Demo</title>
    <script type="module" crossorigin src="https://chdn.zudoku.dev/latest/main.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" crossorigin href="https://chdn.zudoku.dev/latest/style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div data-api-url="https://api.example.com/openapi.json"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### üß± Getting started templates

## Zudoku use cases

Zudoku is a flexible and highly customizable framework so it can be used to create many things, including:

- Standalone documentation websites
- OpenAPI or GraphQL schema powered API documentation
- A developer portal with combined documentation and fully function API reference with authentication, testing and support for your user accounts.
- Internal documentation

# üéì Examples

- [Rick & Morty API](https://zudoku.zuplopreview.net/demo?api-url=https://rickandmorty.zuplo.io/openapi.json)
- [Zuplo API Documentation](https://docs-zudoku.pages.dev/)

# üéØ Motivation

At Zuplo, we couldn‚Äôt find an open-source solution that met our high standards for both trustworthiness and programmability, so we decided to create our own. And since no one chooses Zuplo solely because of our documentation, we felt great about open-sourcing this tool and making it easy to self-host.

We hope that if you use it, you‚Äôll think fondly of Zuplo, and one day, when you‚Äôre looking for a gateway or API management product, you‚Äôll consider us as a vendor to evaluate.

Zudoku will always be open-source. It will always be free.
